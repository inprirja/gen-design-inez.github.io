How do they compare with your expectations? Did the users have difficulties understanding your work, and what they were supposed to do? What was their response? Based on the testing results what would you improve on, future work?</p>

    <p5> I struggled quite a lot during the user testing. 
        Conducting it was definitely harder than I thought. </p5>

    <h3>Struggles</h3>
    
    
    <p4> The process of conducting it was quite a handful to do, since in the end it was Brice's program that we decided to the perform user-testing. His one requires a screen-capture app so that we can capture the gesture of the audience as well as the 'drawing' that they did based on their hand gesture. Since I live with 4 of my roomates, it seems logical that it was me that did the user testing. So I did. The first thing that I searched whose room I want to conduct the user testing in. I decided to use Sabrina's! Since her is the most well-lit compared to the rest of me and my roomates room.

</div>
        
     
    <p4> But besides that, I also tried and borrowed Sabrina's laptop. Since I'm using Windows and she uses mac, I thought it would be easier to use a laptop where there is already a pre-built screencapture app. Sabrina also helped me a lot in terms of setting up. I asked all of my roomate to help me with the user-testing, and they did! </p4>

    <h3>Q & A answer</h3> 
    
    <p4>
    There were 5 questions that we decided to ask alongside the user-testing. Here are the questions as well as some of the answers.The Conditions: the first 3 user testing : using Sabrina mac.( Natasya, Dea, Sabrina) whereas the remaning 2 uses my computer. ( Brigitta, Celine ).
    </p4>
    
    <p2>
    "What is it about the program that you like 
    <br>and you dont like?"
    </p2>
    
    <p4>    
    N: Its interesting and colorful. But it’s disturbing how lagging it was when I move my hands. The direction comes slowly 
    <br> 
    D: I like that it allows you to draw on the screen and see the drawing, but what I dont like is the lagging. Because its using a laptop. With better equipment, you can develop this better. 
    <br> 
    S: I like that its creative, I never thought we could program it to capture our right hand, and detect as it move. But I don’t like that it’s very laggy, and its hard for me to reach a part of the screen I want to draw on. 
    <br> 
    B: I like the pastel rainbow colours but I guess I was confused about what reaction was its taking account for. Assuming its the speed of the hand? Like maybe when its slower, its smaller and faster but when its bigger, its … I’m not really sure. 
    <br> 
    C: I think I like how its circles and it’s pretty funny how its formed, but I dont like the colour schemes. I see that kind of colours in like – like sort of toddler colours. 
    </p4>
    
    
    <p2>
    "What function that you want to have that is missing?"
    </p2>
    
    <p4>    
    N: I cant really thinking about it but I was wondering what the colour represents. 
    D: Faster Responding
    <br> 
    S: I think erase function. Because now we have to go back and even if we turn off the green button, and turn it on again, the drawing that we made is still there.
    <br> 
    B: Hm … Maybe if the colour change based on the height where the hand is? For example, if its lower, maybe it’s read or something or maybe when its higher, it changes to another colour. That may be interesting.
    <br> 
    C: Maybe something to do with voice activation?
    </p4>
    
     <p2>
    "Is it smooth enough?"
    </p2>
    
     <p4>    
    N: Not really.
    <br>
    D: Nope.
    <br> 
    S:No.
    <br> 
    B: I’m not sure but kind of I guess. But maybe there is also an intended sense of it being kind of laggy.
    <br>
    C:  I think it’s already smooth, especially they can detect the really small hand gestures. 
    </p4>
    
     <p2>
    "What do you think is the context of this experiment?"
    </p2>
    
    <p4>    
    N: I think the project is about the sensitivity of gestures. At first I didn’t realize, but when I move my hand then I understand the circle’s size follows the speed of my hands, like yeah the circle gets bigger when my speed gets faster so maybe more aware of … ( my gesture’s ) speed.
    <br>
    D: It allows people to draw together.
    <br> 
    S: I guess it kind of plays with our emotions too? Like all the bright colours lead us to be happier in a sense, and if you draw like it engages us and its  kind of fun. I think it’s to make people feel happier. 
    <br> 
    B: Maybe make people more aware of their movements. 
    <br>
    C:  I think it’s mimicking our gestures,  but it’s the other way around. I don’t know maybe it has something to do with wind? I don’t know.

    <h3>Insight</h3>
    
    <p4> As I mentioned before, the 3 first user tester I used Sabrina's mac. Looking at the Q & A asnwer, 3 of them synonymously agree that the program is laggy. But there is a question whether or not is the lag caused by the computer or the program itself? So I decided to try and use my own laptop instead. It took a while to download and search for the screen capture app for Windows. But when I tried the program in my computer, it doesn’t lag as much. Proven by the 2 last user tester that no longer comments on its lagginess. </p4> 
        
    <br> Outcome-wise, after the user-testing, a lot of the people seem to understand what they are supposed to do and the movements come from their hand gestures. Some note that the choosing of color is appropriate and nice. However, only 1 out of the 5 users that we test seem to see the connection between the project’s outcome and our themes which briefly touch on emotion. 2 out of the 5 users feels that the project makes them more aware of their own gestures and the speed of their hands. However, a lot of them seem to think that it is a fascinating project, and the idea of engagement and drawing with their body is interesting. One thing that I observe during the user testing – not sure how significant this is – is that depending on the computer, the program might be lagging. Therefore, in the future if there is the opportunity, it would be better to present this program using better equipment and perhaps even use a projector. It would provide better visualisation and a lot more fun, especially considering the length of width of the space.

     <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
    
    <p4> I would say that the outcome for the p5js program is as expected! I’ve seen Brice code and watching him throughout the process, I can see how the outcome might be. Whereas for the video and the documentation of the user testing, kind of but I still feel like it doesn’t feel as nice as it can be. I am the one who documents the user testing, as all 5 of them combinations of my housemates and friends. But during the process of capturing the interactions, I struggle on finding the best ways to show what the program’s potential as well as capability, and also the place which I conduct the user testing is not great either. </p4>
         
    <p4> I feel like if given the chance, it would be better to perform the user testing with better equipment and in a much better place than now. As for the outcome and observations, I find that some of the insight from my friends are quite interesting and it is fun to be able to see them interact with the program. 
From the project overall, I learn that to be able to code takes time, but I do want to learn more in the future. Whereas team-wise, I learn to be more open and communicate more to my teammates through my ideas and to initiate certain things or to propose the next step of the process. All in all, this has been a fun experience. </p4>
