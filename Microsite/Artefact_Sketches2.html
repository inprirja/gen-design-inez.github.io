        <figcaption> Sketch 1 and Sketch 2 - Sensorial Drawing
    </figcaption> </div2> 
    
    
<p4> Our team had 2 ideas. One of them is sensorial drawing where the audience can move their hands and translate their gestures into drawing. It's inspired by one of Andreas's code, where there is dots that can detect people's sekelton from their torso upwards. We thought that it would be an interesting thing to see if we can develop the code further to the point where p5js can detect the hands of the person and the person can 'draw' just by moving their hands. </p4>
    
    <p4> The idea behind this other the user one is for the user to type in one of the 5 emotions 'sadness', 'anger', 'joy, 'disgust', and 'fear', and have the generative art interpreted for the emotion would come apepar. We thought of adding another interactive element by using sounds or maybe trackpad. Since Brice is doing the other project, me and Maureen decided to divide the workload and try to code ourselves. 
    <br> 
        
    Yet in the end, due to the time crunch, the second idea which is the keyboard one - we are unable to finish. However, I did learn quite a bit and made 1 out of the 5 ( Sadness, Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Happy ) emotion. Here is how I did it and the step-by-step that I took.

    <br>
    <br> 
    <br> 
        
        I was assigned to visualize the emotion 'sadness'. So I decided to look for a reference which I can tweak out, change, and use. I found something called 'snowflake-falling' thorugh the 'examples' list in p5js. It seems quite simple and I can see which element I can change in order to make the visualization of sadness ( in this case; rain ). </p4>

        2.Rain - Sadness
            <br> 
            <br> I tried to search for the kind function that makes the  
            <br> snowflake twirl and change it while also changing the 
            <br> background.

        3.Gradient
            <br> 
            <br> I searched how to make a gradient for the background, since
            <br> I feel like it can make the program somewhat more alive
          </figcaption2>

        4.Gradient & Rain - if the p5js does not show up, refresh
            <br>
            <br> I tried to combine both the gradient and rain, but
            <br> instead of droplets - this happened.

        6.Sadness
            <br> 
            <br> So I tried asking Brice for help and he did it! Exactly
            <br> how I imagined it to be.

        4.Sadness + MouseX - Hover Mouse over. 
              <br> 
              <br> So after it's done, I tried thinking of how can I make
              <br> it a bit more interactive? I decided to use the function 
              <br> MouseX instead! Compared to adding audio, changing mouseX 
              <br> is quite an easy thing. But I like it! Especially the way
              <br> droplets become smaller and taller depending on where the mouse is.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    
    
    <p4> It's quite a shame that in the end, the code I made doesn't get to be shown in the final product. However, I do feel that it may be for the better, since the time-crunch as well as the current situation with COVID-19 has provide a lot of struggle, and to over-exert ourselves in order to finish is not good for the long run. As for the team-work, I would say it's quite nice but I feel that the communication between us 3 can be improved. Nevertheless, I really do enjoy the process of learning code! </p4>
    
    <p4> I realize that it’s something that I still want to peruse and understand better in the future since looking at a lot of my friend’s and also Andreas’s sketches made me realize how interactive and engaging and fun Generative Design can be. I feel like there’s still a lot to explore. And for the application, I feel like my work can just be a fun thing that people can look at or engage in. I don’t wish for a lot or see it being applied in a huge scale, but maybe for whoever seeing it to feel ‘Wow. This is cool!’ or even ‘How do they do it?’ is enough. </p4>
